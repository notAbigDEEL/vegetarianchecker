# vegetarianchecker
 App using the Open Food Facts API to check if the ingredients of a given food item are vegetarian. 

I made this using HTML/CSS/Javascript. You can find it here: https://vegchecker.netlify.app/

The app takes in a 12 digit barcode and then searches the Open Food Facts API and returns a list of all ingredients along with if they are vegetarian or not. You can test with code: 051000134592
